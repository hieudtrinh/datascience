# | Now let's plot a histogram of the price of the 53940 diamonds in this
# | dataset. Recall that a histogram requires only one variable of the data, so
# | run the R command qplot with the first argument price and the argument data
# | set equal to diamonds. This will show the frequency of different diamond
# | prices.
qplot(price, data = diamonds)
# `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.


# | Not only do you get a histogram, but you also get a message about the
# | binwidth defaulting to range/30. Recall that range refers to the spread or
# | dispersion of the data, in this case price of diamonds. Run the R command
# | range now with diamonds$price as its argument.

range(diamonds$price)
# [1]   326 18823

# | Rerun qplot now with 3 arguments. The first is price, the second is data set
# | equal to diamonds, and the third is binwidth set equal to 18497/30). (Use the
# | up arrow to save yourself some typing.) See if the plot looks familiar.
qplot(price, data = diamonds, binwidth = 18497/30)

# | You're probably sick of it but rerun qplot again, this time with 4 arguments.
# | The first 3 are the same as the last qplot command you just ran (price, data
# | set equal to diamonds, and binwidth set equal to 18497/30). (Use the up arrow
# | to save yourself some typing.) The fourth argument is fill set equal to cut.
# | The shape of the histogram will be familiar, but it will be more colorful.
qplot(price, data = diamonds, binwidth = 18497/30, fill = cut)


# | Now we'll replot the histogram as a density function which will show the
# | proportion of diamonds in each bin. This means that the shape will be similar
# | but the scale on the y-axis will be different since, by definition, the
# | density function is nonnegative everywhere, and the area under the curve is
# | one. To do this, simply call qplot with 3 arguments. The first 2 are price
# | and data (set equal to diamonds). The third is geom which should be set equal
# | to the string "density". Try this now.
qplot(price, data = diamonds, geom = "density")

# | Rerun qplot, this time with 4 arguments. The first 2 are the usual, and the
# | third is geom set equal to "density". The fourth is color set equal to cut.
# | Try this now.

qplot(price, data = diamonds, geom = "density", color = cut)


# | See how easily qplot did this? Four of the five cuts have 2 peaks, one at
# | price $1000 and the other between $4000 and $5000. The exception is the Fair
# | cut which has a single peak at $2500. This gives us a little more
# | understanding of the histogram we saw before.

# | Let's start with carat and price. Use these as the first 2 arguments of
# | qplot. The third should be data set equal to the dataset. Try this now.
qplot(carat, price, data = diamonds)

# | Now rerun the same command, except add a fourth parameter, shape, set equal
# | to cut.

qplot(carat, price, data = diamonds, shape = cut)
# Warning message:
#   Using shapes for an ordinal variable is not advised 

# | The same scatterplot appears, except the cuts of the diamonds are
# | distinguished by different symbols. The legend at the right tells you which
# | symbol is associated with each cut. These are small and hard to read, so
# | rerun the same command, except this time instead of setting the argument
# | shape equal to cut, set the argument color equal to cut.
qplot(carat, price, data = diamonds, color = cut)

# | We'll rerun the plot you just did (carat,price,data=diamonds and color=cut)
# | but add an additional parameter. Use geom_smooth with the method set equal to
# | the string "lm".
qplot(carat,price,data=diamonds, color=cut) + geom_smooth(method="lm")
# `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'

# | Again, we see the same scatterplot, but slightly more compressed and showing
# | 5 regression lines, one for each cut of diamonds. It might be hard to see,
# | but around each line is a shadow showing the 95% confidence interval. We see,
# | unsurprisingly, that the better the cut, the steeper (more positive) the
# | slope of the lines.

# | Finally, let's rerun that plot you just did qplot(carat,price,data=diamonds,
# | color=cut) + geom_smooth(method="lm") but add one (just one) more argument to
# | qplot. The new argument is facets and it should be set equal to the formula
# | .~cut. Recall that the facets argument indicates we want a multi-panel plot.
# | The symbol to the left of the tilde indicates rows (in this case just one)
# | and the symbol to the right of the tilde indicates columns (in this five, the
# | number of cuts). Try this now.
qplot(carat,price,data=diamonds, color=cut, facets = . ~ cut) + geom_smooth(method="lm")
# `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'

# Which types of plot does qplot plot?
#   
# 1: all of the others
# 2: histograms
# 3: box and whisker plots

# | Any and all of the above choices work; qplot is just that good. What does the
# | gg in ggplot2 stand for?

# | Now for some ggplots.

# | First create a graphical object g by assigning to it the output of a call to
# | the function ggplot with 2 arguments. The first is the dataset diamonds and
# | the second is a call to the function aes with 2 arguments, depth and price.
# | Remember you won't see any result.
g <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(depth, price))

# | Does g exist? Yes! Type summary with g as an argument to see what it holds.

summary(g)
# data: carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, price, x, y, z
# [53940x10]
# mapping:  x = ~depth, y = ~price
# faceting: <ggproto object: Class FacetNull, Facet, gg>
#   compute_layout: function
# draw_back: function
# draw_front: function

# setup_data: function
# setup_params: function

# super:  <ggproto object: Class FacetNull, Facet, gg>
  

# | We see that g holds the entire dataset. Now suppose we want to see a
# | scatterplot of the relationship. Add to g a call to the function geom_point
# | with 1 argument, alpha set equal to 1/3.



g+geom_point(alpha = 1/3)
# | That's somewhat interesting. We see that depth ranges from 43 to 79, but the
# | densest distribution is around 60 to 65. Suppose we want to see if this
# | relationship (between depth and price) is affected by cut or carat. We know
# | cut is a factor with 5 levels (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, and Ideal).
# | But carat is numeric and not a discrete factor. Can we do this?

# | Of course! That's why we asked. R has a handy command, cut, which allows you
# | to divide your data into sets and label each entry as belonging to one of the
# | sets, in effect creating a new factor. First, we'll have to decide where to
# | cut the data.

# | Let's divide the data into 3 pockets, so 1/3 of the data falls into each.
# | We'll use the R command quantile to do this. Create the variable cutpoints
# | and assign to it the output of a call to the function quantile with 3
# | arguments. The first is the data to cut, namely diamonds$carat; the second is
# | a call to the R function seq. This is also called with 3 arguments, (0, 1,
# | and length set equal to 4). The third argument to the call to quantile is the
# | boolean na.rm set equal to TRUE.
cutpoints <- quantile(diamonds$carat, seq(0,1,length = 4), na.rm = TRUE)

cutpoints
# 0% 33.33333% 66.66667%      100% 
#   0.20      0.50      1.00      5.01 

range(diamonds$carat)
# [1] 0.20 5.01

# | We see a 4-long vector (explaining why length was set equal to 4). We also
# | see that .2 is the smallest carat size in the dataset and 5.01 is the
# | largest. One third of the diamonds are between .2 and .5 carats and another
# | third are between .5 and 1 carat in size. The remaining third are between 1
# | and 5.01 carats. Now we can use the R command cut to label each of the 53940
# | diamonds in the dataset as belonging to one of these 3 factors. Create a new
# | name in diamonds, diamonds$car2 by assigning it the output of the call to
# | cut. This command takes 2 arguments, diamonds$carat, which is what we want to
# | cut, and cutpoints, the places where we'll cut.
diamonds$car2 <- cut(diamonds$carat, cutpoints)

# | Now we can continue with our multi-facet plot. First we have to reset g since
# | we changed the dataset (diamonds) it contained (by adding a new column).
# | Assign to g the output of a call to ggplot with 2 arguments. The dataset
# | diamonds is the first, and a call to the function aes with 2 arguments
# | (depth,price) is the second.
g <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(depth,price))

summary(g)
# data: carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, price, x, y, z, car2
# [53940x11]
# mapping:  x = ~depth, y = ~price
# faceting: <ggproto object: Class FacetNull, Facet, gg>
#   compute_layout: function
# draw_back: function
# draw_front: function

# params: list
# setup_data: function
# setup_params: function
# shrink: TRUE
# train_scales: function
# vars: function
# super:  <ggproto object: Class FacetNull, Facet, gg>

# | Now add to g calls to 2 functions. This first is a call to geom_point with
# | the argument alpha set equal to 1/3. The second is a call to the function
# | facet_grid using the formula cut ~ car2 as its argument.
g+geom_point(alpha=1/3)+facet_grid(cut ~ car2)

# | We see a multi-facet plot with 5 rows, each corresponding to a cut factor.
# | Not surprising. What is surprising is the number of columns. We were
# | expecting 3 and got 4. Why?
  
# | The first 3 columns are labeled with the cutpoint boundaries. The fourth is
# | labeled NA and shows us where the data points with missing data (NA or Not
# | Available) occurred. We see that there were only a handful (12 in fact) and
# | they occurred in Very Good, Premium, and Ideal cuts. We created a vector,
# | myd, containing the indices of these datapoints. Look at these entries in
# | diamonds by typing the expression diamonds[myd,]. The myd tells R what rows
# | to show and the empty column entry says to print all the columns.

# | We see these entries match the plots. Whew - that's a relief. The car2 field
# | is, in fact, NA for these entries, but the carat field shows they each had a
# | carat size of .2. What's going on here?

# | Actually our plot answers this question. The boundaries for each column
# | appear in the gray labels at the top of each column, and we see that the
# | first column is labeled (0.2,0.5]. This indicates that this column contains
# | data greater than .2 and less than or equal to .5. So diamonds with carat
# | size .2 were excluded from the car2 field.

# | Finally, recall the last plotting command
# | (g+geom_point(alpha=1/3)+facet_grid(cut~car2)) or retype it if you like and
# | add another call. This one to the function geom_smooth. Pass it 3 arguments,
# | method set equal to the string "lm", size set equal to 3, and color equal to
# | the string "pink".

g+geom_point(alpha=1/3)+facet_grid(cut ~ car2)+geom_smooth(method="lm", size=3, color="pink")
# `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'

# | Nice thick regression lines which are somewhat interesting. You can add
# | labels to the plot if you want but we'll let you experiment on your own.

# | Lastly, ggplot2 can, of course, produce boxplots. This final exercise is the
# | sum of 3 function calls. The first call is to ggplot with 2 arguments,
# | diamonds and a call to aes with carat and price as arguments. The second call
# | is to geom_boxplot with no arguments. The third is to facet_grid with one
# | argument, the formula . ~ cut. Try this now.
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price))+geom_boxplot()+facet_grid(. ~ cut)
# Warning message:
#   Continuous y aesthetic -- did you forget aes(group=...)? 
  
# | Yes! A boxplot looking like marshmallows about to be roasted. Well done and
# | congratulations! You've finished this jewel of a lesson. Hope it paid off!
